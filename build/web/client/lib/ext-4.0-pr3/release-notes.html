                </li>
                <li>
                    General Enhancements
                    <ul>
                        <li>A plethora of updates to the backward compatibility legacy files and guide</li>
                        <li>Implemented combineErrors and combineLabels features in FieldContainer</li>
                        <li>Added server-side usage support for Ext4: hammerJS and nodeJS tested</li>
                        <li>Selection Model will now maintain last focused element in the View</li>
                        <li>Add the ability to be able to load a single record with data reader</li>
                        <li>Change shortcut easing functions to match CSS ones and added easeInOut. Benchmarked to be 300% faster at a minimum</li>
                        <li>Add setItemSize method for Containers as a central method for all child item sizing</li>
                        <li>Implement framing using background-position instead of background-image. This resolves the issue with the browser making a request to a 404 page for each framed component that doesn't have any generated framing css</li>
                        <li>Preliminary support for onClick added for charts</li>
                        <li>Implement Chart Mask mixin. Allows for selection of an area of a chart.  This will be mixed into Axes as well for the next release.</li>
                        <li>Add a new parseStyles method to transform a css string to an object with a bunch of properties. Use this new method in applyStyles in DomHelper and also in AbstractComponent</li>
                        <li>Add new function to check if the format contains date/day info (ie. not time) - used in TimeField</li>
                        <li>Add withinBox method to Draw</li>
                        <li>Ext.Array.intersect method added</li>
                        <li>Ext.Array.difference method added</li>
                        <li>Ext.Array.union shortcut method for merge</li>
                        <li>Begin clip-rect support in SVG and VML (incomplete)</li>
                        <li>Change HashMap to no longer throw error when adding an existing key.  Warn instead</li>
                        <li>Added a cls into the rowexpander header cell and row cell for the first cell</li>
                        <li>Added x-hidden cls for backward compatibility</li>
                        <li>Update css for grids so it now uses css3 throughout</li>
                        <li>Added images for special cells in grid</li>
                        <li>All tabs have a font-weight of bold</li>
                        <li>Move caching logic out of Anchor layout's anchorSpec functions to the base layout engine</li>
                        <li>Add floor argument for example-data generator</li>
                        <li>Removed deprecated layouts</li>
                        <li>Accordion layout only animates during expand/collapse of child Panels</li>
                        <li>Button layout caches measured styles for efficiency</li>
                        <li>Feed Viewer uses CycleButton to cycle through the preview pane options</li>
                        <li>Bringing a floating Component (such as a Window) to the front of its ZIndex stack now focuses it on a 10ms delay. Focusing several Windows in succession results in only the last Window actually receiving focus</li>
                        <li>Refactor Border layout to use new Element effects methods to slide regions in and out</li>
                        <li>TabBar now overrides the layout align option set by the Header superclass</li>
                        <li>Changed tabs to use the base-color and not hard coded colors</li>
                        <li>Changed button to no longer use hardcoded variables</li>
                        <li>Make TabPanel dock the TabBar according to the tabPosition config</li>
                        <li>SVG text is now unselectable</li>
                        <li>A new 'errorchange' event has been added to Ext.form.Labelable, fired whenever set/unsetActiveError is called. This is similar to the 'validitychange' event on Ext.form.Field but is fired by Labelable components which are not Fields, such as FieldContainer. It also fires when the validity is staying invalid but the message changes, which is more useful in some cases</li>
                        <li> BaseField now adds a .x-form-field-invalid class to the inputEl, and this is used in the CSS rather than using the outer .x-form-invalid and a descendant selector; this allows proper styling of child fields of a FieldContainer when the container has an error message displayed</li>
                        <li>ComboBox clearValue method added back in</li>
                        <li>Toolbar now uses the base-color</li>
                        <li>Add extra checks to figure out whether we need to do DST parsing or not for Date function</li>
                        <li>Add triggerNCls-over and triggerNCls-click classes to individual trigger buttons, so each one can be given interaction styling independently rather than requiring compound class selectors. Fixes spinner button states in IE</li>
                        <li>FeedViewer example: Button icon CSS rules should only override the background image. Otherwise Ext-specific styling rules will not apply</li>
                        <li>Group class attached to the icon element for style targeting in CheckItem</li>
                        <li>ComponentQuery can now accept back-to-back pseudo-class selectors, like :not():not():custom</li>
                        <li>Move back to setInterval instead of setTimer as a base for animation timing.</li>
                        <li>Allow for binding of multiple axes to a series via an array</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    API Changes
                    <ul>
                        <li>AbstractLayout removed, Layout remains the base class now all AbstractLayout dependencies to Layout</li>
                        <li>AbstractDataView has new getter method getItemSelector</li>
                        <li>afteranimate event now fired as the last operation of the Anim.end method (instead of the beginning of the end)</li>
                        <li>layoutItem moved to ContainerLayout from Layout</li>
                        <li>Move resizeHandles config out of Window to Component</li>
                        <li>Box will no longer use CSS margins. It reads CSS margins and adds them to the configured margins, and clears CSS margins. This allows for more accurate positioning</li>
                        <li>Ext.form.CompositeField has been deprecated, as FieldContainer is now at feature parity. Alias has been added to compat file</li>
                        <li>Ext.form.Field#checkValidityChange has been removed, its logic has been moved into the validate method so it gets run when validate is called directly</li>
                        <li>Chart zoom functionality being changed to zoom the appropriate portions of the chart instead of everything</li>
                    </ul>

                    <li>Implement endDrag method in DragTracker</li>
                    <li>Button now has a overMenuTrigger flag</li>
                    <li>Rename pressClass to pressedCls and add check before cls removal in ClickRepeater</li>
                    <li>Remove unecessary onDisable/onEnable override in menu.Item and Button</li>
                    <li>Rename disabledClass to disableCls in Component</li>
                    <li>Removed the positionAnimation property since it is no longer necessary with the Component.animate API</li>
                    <li>Removed reverse parameter from keyframed animations</li>
                    <li>The pause and running flags now maintained within keyframed animations (Animator.js)</li>
                    <li>Update the RowSelectionModel constructor so we can add more useful contextual information to the event</li>
                    <li>Menu now extends Panel to support docking</li>
                    <li>Add isOnLeftEdge and isOnRightEdge for Grid Header events</li>
                    <li>Grid HeaderContainer dragging property now defaults to false</li>
                    <li>Animate's hasActiveFx will now return the current fx.Anim object if there is one or return false if none are active</li>
                    <li>Renamed tab reorderer plugin to TabReorderer</li>
                    <li>Renamed MenuMgr to MenuManager</li>
                    <li>Remove Ext.isForcedBorderBox property</li>
                    <li>Remove the experimental enableForcedBoxModel property</li>
                    <li>Ext.isBorderBox logic now reflects the use of css box model</li>
                    <li>CheckboxGroup/RadioGroup setValue method has been simplified; it now only accepts a single format of an object of name-value mappings. The old additional formats will be added to the legacy compatibility layer as an override</li>
                    <li>CheckboxGroup/RadioGroup getValue method has been changed to return an object of similar format to what is accepted by setValue for internal consistency. The old behavior has been moved to a new getChecked() method</li>
                    <li>The methods setRawValue, getRawValue, valueToRaw, and rawToValue have been moved out of Field and into BaseField; this is to make the main Field interface simpler and more easily implemented on components which do not have the concept of an underlying "raw value" like CheckboxGroup</li>
                    <li>Field now has a areValuesEqual method which compares values returned from getValue() for logical equality, and is used anywhere a comparison is necessary such as checkChanges() and isDirty(). The base implementation is a simple string comparison, but can be overridden by fields with more complex values</li>
                    <li>Field now has a resetOriginalValue method which is called by the form when trackResetOnLoad=true instead of setting originalValue directly, this allows the behavior to be overridden by field subclasses</li>
                    <li>Field's getSubmitValue method has been changed to a more powerful getSubmitData method, which returns a mapping object of name-value pairs; this allows single fields to return multiple values under different names rather than being limited to a single name per field. The getSubmitValue method has been retained as a helper but moved down to BaseField</li>
                    <li>Introduced a batchChanges method on field as a utility for preventing excessive firing of change events in fields such as CheckboxGroup that have many sub-fields who may be updated as a batch</li>
                    <li>Basic's isValid method has been changed back to its old behavior where it iterates through all fields in the form and triggers error markings. A new hasInvalidField method has been added to retain the more efficient short-circuited validity checking and preventing error markings</li>
                </ul>
