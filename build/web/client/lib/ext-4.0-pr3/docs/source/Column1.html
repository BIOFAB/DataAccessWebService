 * @class Ext.layout.container.Column
 * @extends Ext.layout.container.HBox
 * &lt;p&gt;This is the layout style of choice for creating structural layouts in a multi-column format where the width of
 * each column can be specified as a percentage or fixed width, but the height is allowed to vary based on the content.
 * This class is intended to be extended or created via the layout:&#39;column&#39; {@link Ext.container.Container#layout} config,
 * and should generally not need to be created directly via the new keyword.&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;ColumnLayout does not have any direct config options (other than inherited ones), but it does support a
 * specific config property of &lt;b&gt;&lt;tt&gt;columnWidth&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;/b&gt; that can be included in the config of any panel added to it.  The
 * layout will use the columnWidth (if present) or width of each panel during layout to determine how to size each panel.
 * If width or columnWidth is not specified for a given panel, its width will default to the panel&#39;s width (or auto).&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;The width property is always evaluated as pixels, and must be a number greater than or equal to 1.
 * The columnWidth property is always evaluated as a percentage, and must be a decimal value greater than 0 and
 * less than 1 (e.g., .25).&lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;The basic rules for specifying column widths are pretty simple.  The logic makes two passes through the
 * set of contained panels.  During the first layout pass, all panels that either have a fixed width or none
 * specified (auto) are skipped, but their widths are subtracted from the overall container width.  During the second
 * pass, all panels with columnWidths are assigned pixel widths in proportion to their percentages based on
 * the total &lt;b&gt;remaining&lt;/b&gt; container width.  In other words, percentage width panels are designed to fill the space
 * left over by all the fixed-width and/or auto-width panels.  Because of this, while you can specify any number of columns
 * with different percentages, the columnWidths must always add up to 1 (or 100%) when added together, otherwise your
 * layout may not render as expected.  Example usage:&lt;/p&gt;
 * <br><span style="display: none">**/</span>// All columns are percentages -- they must add up to 1
