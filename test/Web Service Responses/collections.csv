cFAB1,Pilot Project,The Pilot Project collection consists of genetic constructs composed from available well known genetic elements. At this time BIOFAB staff have not yet taken care to define the precise functional boundaries of these genetic elements. For example a part labeled as a "promoter" may include sequences encoding all or part of a 5\' UTR downstream of a transcription start site. Part of the mission of the BIOFAB is to define compatible sets of genetic objects with precise and composable boundaries. Such well engineered parts will be noted once available.,1.0
